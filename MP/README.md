# **Comparison of Methodologies to Fit Microbial Population Growth Models**

## About
Author: Sam Turner

This directory contains the code and data required to compile my miniproject. To perform the analysis and compile the write up, call **run_MiniProject.sh** from within the **code** directory. Please allow up to **10 minutes** for the report to compile, as the model fitting take about this long. 

## Requirements

The directory for each Week contains four subdirectories: **code**, **data**, **results** (empty, populated when scripts from code are run), and **sandbox** (code and data used in development).
